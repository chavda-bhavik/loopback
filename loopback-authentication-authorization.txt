Loopback allows to create Role and principals to use in authentication and authorization

What is Principal?
    Principal is a bridge between Role and User to do task.
What is Role?
    Role is Collection of tasks that are permitted to certain model.

Create Static Role and assigning Principal to the Role.
    let user = await User.create({ name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@gmail.com", password: "johndoe" })
    let adminRole = await Role.create({ name: "admin" })
    let principal = await adminRole.principals.create({
        principalType: RoleMapping.USER,
        principalId: user._id,
    })

Now Only JohnDoe will be allowed to do task that are defined in Access Control List(ACL). Like.
    lb acl
        select model = <model-name> (i.e. dishes),
        ACL Scope = A Single method,
        access type = create,
        role = Admin,
        permission to apply = Explicitly grant access
